      <p class="faq-question">What is a Food Tour?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">Hungry For food tours take you to the best eating spots and watering holes in town. Imagine a walking tour, however replace most of the long list of dates and names with delicious food (and drink!) making a truly indulgent food experience. You’ll also get an insight into the area along the way and a true local insight into the area with fun facts and bits of local gossip.</p>
      <p class="faq-question">How long is each food tour?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">Our London and Edinburgh food tours are normally around 2.5 - 3.5 hours long, however if you opt for a personalised food tour then it is completely up to you! We will discuss how long you want your experience to be beforehand and adapt it to your group's needs.</p>
      <p class="faq-question">Are Hungry For food and drink tours suitable for vegetarians?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">Yes! Just let us know if you have any vegetarians (or vegans!) beforehand and we will absolutely do our best to ensure their alternative food items are just as delicious. If your whole group is vegetarian or vegan then why not check out our personalised tours and we can create a mouth watering vegetarian food tour just for you!</p>
      <p class="faq-question">How much will we eat/drink?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">During a Hungry For food tour that lasts approximately 3 hours, you will indulge in the equivalent of a very large meal (starters, mains, desserts and more!) therefore we suggest that you come hungry!</p>
      <p class="faq-question">How much is a food/drink tour?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">Our tours are not only the BEST, but extremely competitively priced. Our all-inclusive Soho food tour costs £79 per person, and our Edinburgh Pub tour is only £29 per person</p>
      <p class="faq-question">Where do we meet? / Where does the experience end?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">The meeting spot will depend on the area that the experience takes place. All experiences begin and end close to tube or train stations.</p>

      <p class="faq-question">What time does it start?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">Our London experiences run on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11:45am. Our Edinburgh experience runs on Mondays and Wednesdays at 6pm, and on Saturdays at 3pm.</p>
      <p class="faq-question">What is the maximum number of guests you can take?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">Hungry For Tours are public tours, which means we will take up to 16 total guests. If you book for 3 people, there may be up to 13 new friends waiting to join you.</p>
      <p class="faq-question">What is included?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">For our Hungry for Soho tour, all the food & drink throughout the experience is included in the cost per person. Our Edinburgh tour includes a welcome cocktail, but you will purchase a drink of your own choice at each stop.</p>
      <p class="faq-question">Can I ask to make amendments to my experience?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">We will do our best to accomodate any necessary amendments, but cannot make any promises. All common dietary requirements can be catered for.</p>
      <p class="faq-question">Is there a lot of walking?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">This is a food experience, not a walking tour therefore we never like to include too much walking as for us it is all about the food and drink! However there may be short walks in between venues and past some of the cultural sights in the area. If you have walking restrictions in your group then feel free to mention this prior to the experience and we can aim to come up with a solution that suit you.</p>
      <p class="faq-question">Can I purchase it as a gift for somebody?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">Yes! We think our London food experiences are the perfect gift idea. Just head to our Gift Vouchers page.</p>
